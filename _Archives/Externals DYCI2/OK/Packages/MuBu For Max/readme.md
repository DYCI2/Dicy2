# MuBuForMax
by ISMM Team @ Ircam - Centre Pompidou (http://www.ircam.fr)

This version requires Max 7.1 or higher.

##### Easy installation :
Select **Show Package Manager** in the **File** menu, and browse to install **MuBuForMax**

##### Manual installation:
The recommended installation procedure consists in copying the **MuBuForMax** folder to your **Max Package folder**.
Your **Max Package folder** is typically located in your **Documents** folder, more specifically :
**~/Documents/Max 8/Packages** if you are using Max 8
**~/Documents/Max 7/Packages** if you are using Max 7

#### Windows release:

The Windows release was built with Visual Studio 2019. To make it work, you'll need to install the **VS Redistributable Package 2019**, which you can download for free from here :

#####  Quarantine on macOS 10.15 Catalina

If you are using **macOS 10.15 Catalina**, it is possible that the **MuBuForMax** files, downloaded from the Ircam Forum,  have been **quarantined** by the OS. As the result, the mubu external objets wouldn't load in Max.
To avoid this issue, you need to remove the quarantine. 
To do so, you need to open the Terminal application, and execute the following command :

xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine [path/to/extern/directory]

Examples :
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine **~/Documents/Max 8/Packages/MuBuForMax**
xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine **~/Documents/Max 7/Packages/MuBuForMax**

Once you have removed the quarantine, you can start Max, and MuBuForMax external objects should work properly.
