# DYCI2_library


The DYCI2 library contains a collection of generative agents and tools for smart composition and human-machine co-improvisation. 
It integrates the results of the [DYCI2 project](http://repmus.ircam.fr/dyci2/home) and shapes a next-generation software with regard to [OMax](https://github.com/DYCI2/OMax4). 

__A conference paper about the DYCI2 library can be downloaded [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01583089/document).__

_**To use DYCI2 applications in Max directly, please go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/DYCI2/Dyci2Lib/releases). The following sections of this document are intended for developers wishing to craft the Python core of the DYCI2 agents.**_

------

## Repository

This repository contains: 

* __Tutorials__  with complete standard DYCI2 functionalities. These self-contained Max applications and can be used as such by users who are not interested in building new patches.

* The __Max DYCI2 library__ of musical agents interfacing with the generation engine developped in Python. 

* The __Python DYCI2 library__, defining models and tools for creative generation of sequences (and in particular musical sequences) from models of sequences. It implements several models, generative heuristics, time management strategies, and architectures of interactive agents. 

Advanced users and developpers can use the Python library autonomously. See the tutorials corresponding to the different modulesHtml doc: http://repmus.ircam.fr/downloads/docs/DYCI2_library/. PDF doc: in DYCI2lib/Python_library.


------

## Requirements
* Mac OS
* Max 8
* Python 3.9 and >
* Mubu for Max: Open Max, File / Show Package Manager, Search "Mubu for Max", Install.
* Catart by Mubu:
	* DYCI2 Repository: if you **cloned** the repository or **downloaded it from the main page**, make sure that you also cloned the [Catart](https://github.com/Ircam-RnD/catart-mubu) submodule or your directory `Dyci2Lib/Max_library/external/catart`will be empty !
	* DYCI2 Release: Included in DYCI2lib (but check their repository https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/catart-mubu/ !)

## Installation
* Drag the DYCI2lib directory wherever you want (but not in Max packages / libraries !) and add its path into Max's search path (in Max: Options/File preferences... then add the path WITH THE SUBFOLDERS). 
* Insert the media files downloaded at http://repmus.ircam.fr/nika/dyci2_library in "MaxPatches/Tutorials/\_ExamplesCorpus\_"
* /!\ The sampling rate of Max MUST be the same as that of the audio file(s) used in the memory(/ies).

## Python configuration
* Download and install the **last** version of Python **3** (https://www.python.org/downloads).
* Open Terminal to install the dependencies: `cd [DRAG_AND_DROP_THE_DIRECTORY_Dyci2lib]`, enter, `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --user`, enter.

------
## C wrapper and OM/OM\# library (work in progress)
* __libdyci2__: a C wrapper to the DYCI2 Python library allowing to compile libdyci2 as a dynamic library,
* __om-dyci2__: a library for using DYCI2/libdyci2 in the OM/o7 computer-aided composition environment,
are available at https://github.com/DYCI2/om-dyci2.

## Troubleshooting
Please write to `jerome.nika@ircam.fr` for any question, or to share with us your projects using DYCI2 !
